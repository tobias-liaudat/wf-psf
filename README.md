<h1 align='center'>WaveDiff</h1>
<h2 align='center'>A differentiable data-driven wavefront-based PSF modelling framework.</h2>


[!WARNING]
The official WaveDiff code and repository can be found at [https://github.com/CosmoStat/wf-psf](https://github.com/CosmoStat/wf-psf).


This repository includes:
- A differentiable PSF model entirely built in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
- A numpy-based PSF simulator [here](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/blob/main/wf_psf/SimPSFToolkit.py).
- All the scripts, jobs and notebooks required to reproduce the results in [arXiv:2203.04908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04908) and [arXiv:2111.12541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12541).

For more information on how to use the WaveDiff model through configurable scripts see the `long-runs` directory's [README](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/blob/main/long-runs/README.md). 

## Proposed framework

A schematic of the proposed framework can be seen below. The PSF model is estimated (trained) using star observations in the field-of-view.

## Install

`wf-psf` is pure python and can be easily installed with `pip`. After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd wf-psf
$ pip install .
```

The package can then be imported in Python as `import wf_psf as wf`. We recommend using the release `1.2.0` for stability as the current main branch is under development.

## Reproducible research

#### [arXiv:2203.04908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04908) Rethinking data-driven point spread function modeling with a differentiable optical model (2022)
_Submitted._

- Use the release 1.2.0.
- All the scripts, jobs and notebooks to reproduce the figures from the article can be found [here](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/tree/main/papers/article_IOP).
- The trained PSF models are found [here](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/tree/main/papers/article_IOP/data/models).
- The input PSF field can be found [here](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/tree/main/data).
- The script used to generate the input PSF field is [this one](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/blob/main/long-runs/LR-PSF-field-gen-coherentFields.py).
- The code required to run the comparison against pixel-based PSF models is in [this directory](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/tree/main/method-comparison).
- The training of the models was done using [this script](https://github.com/tobias-liaudat/wf-psf/blob/main/long-runs/train_eval_plot_script_click.py). In order to match the script's option for the different models with the article you should follow: 
    - `poly->WaveDiff-original`
    - `graph->WaveDiff-graph`
    - `mccd->WaveDiff-Polygraph`

_Note: To run the comparison to other PSF models you need to install them first. See [RCA](https://github.com/CosmoStat/rca), [PSFEx](https://github.com/astromatic/psfex) and [MCCD](https://github.com/CosmoStat/mccd)._
